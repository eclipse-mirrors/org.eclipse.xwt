<h1>Application Integration</h1>
<p>Although XWT is bundled in e4, it is in fact designed, developed
and tested in classic eclipse environment. It can be used in
applications on top of SWT/Jface with or without eclipse platform. So
the integration with standard SWT application is really straight
forward.</p>

<h2>Stand-alone Java application</h2>
The module "org.eclipse.xwt" is the core engine of XWT. It depends
only on SWT/JFace and JFace data binding. It can be used directly in any
stand-alone Java application.

<h2>Eclipse integration</h2>
The plugin "org.eclipse.xwt.pde" takes over this bridge role between
XWT and eclipse environment. It implements mainly all extensions points
to extend XWT at the current stage, more integration facilities will be
provided in next releases.

<h2>Resource loading and UI creation</h2>

<p>This paragraph explains the integration concept of XWT in an
existing SWT application: how an existing classic SWT applications using
XWT. XWT provides some APIs to load a UI component as a child of an
existing Composite via the class XWT.</p>
<p>The customized UI &quot;UserControl&quot; contains a Button with
a selection event, that clicking the button changes the button content from
'Hello, world' to 'OK'.</p>

<p>XWT supports directly integrating user-defined SWT widgets in
your declarative UI. <!-- 
Now integrate the above example into a new XWT
component directly. See the screenshot below.
-->It's quite easy to implement in XWT XML. You need only to declare the
application class path and name in the place where you want. See the
example below, it using <tt>&lt;y:UserControl /&gt;</tt>, <tt>y</tt> is
the class path specified in the root as <tt>xmlns:y =
"clr-namespace:org.eclipse.xwt.test.usercontrol"</tt>.</p>

<p>Run the Container application and click the button. Implicitly,
UserControl application is invoked.</p>
