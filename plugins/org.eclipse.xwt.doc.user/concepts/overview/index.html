<h3><a name="project_01"></a>What is XWT?</h3>
<p>Declarative UI is a new programming paradigm, which is widely  used in Web application development. In Eclipse, UI development in Java is  the only proposed solution. This solution presents several drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High technology pre-requisite as UI developer</li>
  <li>Difficult to separate UI appearance and business logic</li>
  <li>Poor reusability</li>
  <li>Limitation of the dynamic UI support</li>
  <li>Very hard to integrate with development tools </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="images/XWTPosition.png" width="800" height="435"></p>
<p>XWT is designed specially for eclipse to resolve these  problems by providing a foundation infrastructure. It is a UI framework based on an extensible markup language for  application development in declarative programming paradism.
  It adopts directly SWT/JFace UI model as XML serialization model. It uses in fact a direct mapping approach between  XML grammar and UI runtime libraries.</p>
<p>XWT simplifies UI programming. You can create visible UI elements
in the declarative XML markup with a physical separation of the UI
definition from the run-time logic. An XML based declarative language is
very intuitive for creating interfaces ranging from prototype to
production, especially for people with a background in web design and
technologies. Unlike most other markup languages, XWT directly
represents the instantiation of managed objects.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/XWTComponent.png" width="627" height="388"></p>
<p>XWT is XML UI for eclipse.</p>
<ul>
	<li>XWT is a XML dialect</li>
	<li>Designed for human-editable and tooling</li>
	<li>Dynamic mapping with programming model</li>
	<li>Complete declarative UI framework integrated natively with SWT/JFace</li>
    <li>Powerful Declarative Data Binding solution on top of JFace data binding</li>
    <li>Reusable data presentation component</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="project_02"></a>Benefices of XWT for eclipse</h3>
<p>The main benefices of XWT are following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>More human-readable and light-weight markup without ambiguity
	between properties and child type</li>
	<li>High Extensible</li>
	<li>Well defined and complete specification</li>
	<li>Mature and Generic Declarative UI solution</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="project_03"></a>Architecture</h3>

<div align="center"><img src="images/architecture.png" />
  
</div>
<ul>
	<li>SWT Model as XWT Model<br />
	- This model comes from the JavaBean reflection and additional models
	to enhance the limitations of SWT API.</li>
	<li>This model can be changed to another</li>
	<li>XWT provides more concepts on top of XML<br />
	<ul>
		<li>Resource separation between UI and Event handling</li>
		<li>Dynamic mapping with UI Model and programming language</li>
		<li>Resource management</li>
		<li>Markup extensions</li>
		<li>Binding expression language</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
