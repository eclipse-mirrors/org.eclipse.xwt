<h1>Internationalization</h1>
<p>Internationalization is the process of making software that
accommodates differences in language, culture and hardware.
Internationalization presents users with a consistent look, feel and
functionality across different language editions of a product.</p>

<p>The XWT is internationalization support, in this section, we will
move with an example to understand internationalization.</p>

<p>First thing we will require for internationalization is a set of
properties files. Each file contains a key/value pair for each message
that you expect your application to present. The naming format for these
files are <b>*.properties</b>.</p>

is a String type which specifies the path of the message.properties
file. And also the key "title" in <b>*.Properties</b> file should be
declaration here as String.</p>
